# Admin Security Setup

This document explains the security measures implemented for the admin area of the FutureFast website.

## Basic Authentication

The admin area (`/admin/*` routes) is protected using HTTP Basic Authentication implemented through Next.js middleware. This provides a simple but effective first layer of security.

### How It Works

1. When you try to access any page under the `/admin` path, you'll be prompted for a username and password
2. These credentials are checked against the values set in your environment variables
3. If the credentials match, you'll be granted access to the admin area
4. If not, you'll continue to see the authentication prompt

### Configuration

The authentication credentials are configured using environment variables:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: The username required to access the admin area (default: "admin")
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password required to access the admin area

These should be set in your Vercel project settings for production, and in your `.env.local` file for local development.

## Setting Up in Production

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
3. Add the following variables:
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` (set to your desired admin username)
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (set to a strong, secure password)
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

## Setting Up Locally

1. Copy the values from `env.sample` to your `.env.local` file
2. Update the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` values
3. Restart your development server

## Security Considerations

- Basic Authentication sends credentials with each request, so it's important to use HTTPS in production (Vercel provides this by default)
- Choose a strong password that is not used elsewhere
- Consider changing the password periodically
- This implementation is simple but effective for basic protection needs
- For more advanced security requirements, consider implementing a more robust authentication system like NextAuth.js

## Future Enhancements

Potential security enhancements for the future:

1. Implement session-based authentication with NextAuth.js
2. Add two-factor authentication
3. Implement role-based access control for different admin functions
4. Add audit logging for admin actions
5. Set up automatic session timeouts
