# AI Content Extraction System

## ü§ñ Overview

The AI Content Extraction System automatically populates missing fields in your Notion news database by analyzing webpage content from URLs. When you add a news article URL to Notion but leave the title, source, or publication date empty, this system uses OpenAI to extract that information for you.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîç Intelligent Web Scraping**: Fetches webpage content with browser-like headers
- **üß† AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to extract precise metadata  
- **üìä Batch Processing**: Process all incomplete records at once
- **üîÑ Smart Updates**: Only updates empty fields, preserves existing data
- **‚ö° Fast & Efficient**: 1-second delays between requests for respectful scraping
- **üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms and detailed error reporting

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ContentExtractor** (`lib/content-extractor.ts`)
   - Fetches webpage content
   - Extracts meta tags and HTML content
   - Uses OpenAI to analyze and extract structured data

2. **NotionClient** (`lib/notion-client.ts`)
   - Extended with update capabilities
   - Queries incomplete records
   - Updates records with extracted content

3. **AIContentService** (`lib/ai-content-service.ts`)
   - Orchestrates the extraction process
   - Handles batch processing
   - Provides processing statistics

4. **API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/ai-content-extraction/route.ts`)
   - HTTP interface for triggering extraction
   - Supports batch and single URL processing

5. **Test Interface** (`src/app/ai-content-test/page.tsx`)
   - Interactive testing and monitoring dashboard

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Environment Variables

The system uses existing OpenAI configuration. Ensure these are in your `.env.local` file:

```env
# OpenAI API (already used in the project for content generation)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Notion Integration
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_integration_token_here
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_notion_database_id_here
```

### OpenAI API Key Setup

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file
4. Ensure you have credits/billing set up

### Notion Database Schema

Your Notion database must have these properties:
- **Title** (Title type)
- **Source** (Rich Text type)  
- **Publication Date** (Date type)
- **Source URL** (URL type)
- **Status** (Select type with "Published" option)

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Automatic Processing (Recommended)

The system automatically identifies records that need content extraction:
- Records with a `Source URL` but missing `Title`, `Source`, or `Publication Date`

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Get System Status
```bash
GET /api/ai-content-extraction
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "active",
    "incompleteRecords": 5,
    "totalRecords": 25,
    "readyForProcessing": true
  }
}
```

#### Process All Incomplete Records
```bash
POST /api/ai-content-extraction
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "action": "process-all"
}
```

#### Process Single URL
```bash
POST /api/ai-content-extraction
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "action": "process-url",
  "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/15/ai-breakthrough"
}
```

### 3. Test Interface

Visit `http://localhost:3000/ai-content-test` to:
- View system status and statistics
- Test single URL extraction
- Process all incomplete records
- Monitor extraction results

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Content Fetching
```typescript
// Fetches webpage with realistic browser headers
const response = await fetch(url, {
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...',
    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml...',
    // ... more headers
  }
});
```

### 2. AI Analysis
The system sends webpage content to OpenAI with this prompt:

```
Analyze this webpage content and extract:
1. EXACT TITLE: The precise, complete title as published
2. NEWS SOURCE: The publication name (e.g., "TechCrunch", "Forbes")
3. PUBLISHED DATE: The exact publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Response must be valid JSON:
{
  "title": "exact article title here",
  "source": "publication name here", 
  "publishedDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

### 3. Smart Updates
- Only updates empty fields in Notion
- Preserves existing data
- Validates extracted data before updating

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms
If AI extraction fails, the system attempts:
- Meta tag extraction (og:title, article:published_time, etc.)
- Domain-based source extraction
- Current date as fallback for missing dates

## üìä Performance & Costs

### Processing Speed
- **Single URL**: ~3-5 seconds
- **Batch Processing**: ~5 seconds per URL (includes 1s delay)

### OpenAI API Costs
- **Model**: GPT-4o (existing project standard)
- **Tokens per request**: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Estimated cost**: ~$0.005-$0.01 per URL

### Rate Limiting
- 1-second delay between requests
- Respectful to target websites
- Can be adjusted in `AIContentService.delay()`

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adjusting AI Prompts
Edit the prompt in `ContentExtractor.extractWithAI()`:

```typescript
const prompt = `
Your custom extraction instructions here...
`;
```

### Modifying Delays
Change processing delays in `AIContentService`:

```typescript
await this.delay(2000); // 2 seconds instead of 1
```

### Adding New Fields
Extend the extraction to include new fields:

1. Update interfaces in `content-extractor.ts`
2. Modify the AI prompt
3. Update Notion update logic
4. Extend the API responses

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Console Logging
The system provides detailed console logging:
- üîç Starting extraction
- ‚úÖ Successful extractions  
- ‚ùå Failed extractions
- üìä Processing statistics

### Error Handling
Common errors and solutions:

1. **OpenAI API Error**: Check API key and credits
2. **Notion API Error**: Verify token and database permissions
3. **Web Scraping Error**: Some sites block automated requests
4. **Parse Error**: AI response not in expected JSON format

### Test URLs
Good test URLs for different news sources:
- TechCrunch: `https://techcrunch.com/...`
- Forbes: `https://www.forbes.com/...`
- Reuters: `https://www.reuters.com/...`
- BBC: `https://www.bbc.com/news/...`

## üö¶ Best Practices

### 1. Data Quality
- Review AI-extracted content before publishing
- Use the test interface to verify accuracy
- Set up manual review workflows for critical content

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Don't process too many URLs simultaneously
- Respect website terms of service
- Consider implementing additional delays for heavy usage

### 3. Cost Management
- Monitor OpenAI API usage
- Set up billing alerts
- Consider caching results for repeated URLs

### 4. Error Monitoring
- Check console logs regularly
- Set up alerts for high failure rates
- Monitor processing statistics

## üîê Security Considerations

### 1. API Key Protection
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables only
- Consider using secret management services

### 2. Input Validation
- Validate URLs before processing
- Sanitize extracted content
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

### 3. Notion Permissions
- Use minimal required permissions
