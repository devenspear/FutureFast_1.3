# Content Management System

This document explains how to edit the static text content of the FutureFast website using Markdown files.

## Overview

The FutureFast website is designed with a content-first approach, allowing you to edit all static text through Markdown files without touching the code. This makes it easy to update content without developer assistance.

All content is stored in the `/content` directory, organized by section type:

```
/content
  /catalog         # Resource cards in the library grid
  /news            # News items
  /quotes          # Scrolling quotes
  /sections        # Main website sections (hero, about, etc.)
  /site            # Global site settings
  /thought-leaders # Thought leader profiles
```

## How to Edit Content

### Basic Workflow

1. Navigate to the appropriate content file in the `/content` directory
2. Edit the file using Markdown syntax
3. Save the file
4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
5. Vercel will automatically deploy the updated content

### Markdown Format

Each content file follows a standard format with frontmatter (metadata) at the top, enclosed in triple dashes (`---`):

```markdown
---
title: Example Title
description: This is an example description
---

Optional body content here.
```

The frontmatter contains key-value pairs that define the content properties. Different section types have different required properties.

## CloudCannon Integration

All content files are accessible and editable through CloudCannon's content management interface. CloudCannon provides a user-friendly way to edit the Markdown files without having to use Git directly.

To access the CloudCannon editor:

1. Log in to your CloudCannon account
2. Select the FutureFast project
3. Navigate to the "Content" section
4. Choose the file you want to edit
5. Make your changes in the visual editor
6. Save your changes

CloudCannon will automatically commit and push your changes to GitHub, triggering a new deployment on Vercel.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Templates**: When creating new content files, start with the appropriate `_template.md` file
2. **Maintain Formatting**: Keep the frontmatter structure consistent
3. **Optimize Images**: Compress images before uploading to keep the site fast
4. **Preview Changes**: Use the CloudCannon preview feature to see how your changes will look before publishing
5. **Validate Links**: Ensure all URLs are correct and working before saving

## Troubleshooting

If your content changes aren't appearing on the site:

1. Check that you saved the file
2. Verify that the frontmatter format is correct (proper indentation, no missing colons)
3. Ensure the file is in the correct location
4. Check if there are any build errors in the Vercel deployment logs
5. Clear your browser cache to ensure you're seeing the latest version

For more complex issues, consult the development team.
