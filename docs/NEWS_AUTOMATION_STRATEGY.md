# News Automation Strategy for FutureFast.AI

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for automating news content updates in the FutureFast.AI website.

## Current Implementation
- News items are stored as markdown files in `/content/news/`
- Each file contains YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Content is statically generated at build time

## Proposed Automation Solution

### 1. RSS Feed Integration
- Fetch news from multiple RSS feeds
- Parse and process feed items
- Save as markdown files with consistent formatting

### 2. Scheduled Updates

- Automatic commit and push of new content
- Duplicate detection to prevent content duplication

### 3. AI-Powered Enhancement
- Generate summaries using GPT-4
- Content moderation

- Topic categorization

### 4. Content Structure
```markdown

source: "Source Name"
url: "https://example.com/article"
publishedDate: "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
featured: false
