# Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview
The FutureFast.AI content processing system now includes comprehensive error notifications and status tracking to prevent issues from going unnoticed.

## 🔔 **Notification Methods**

### 1. **Notion Database Status (Always Active)**
When you add new URLs to your Notion database, you'll now see:
- **Processing Status** column: Shows "Processing", "Completed", or "Error"
- **Processing Error** column: Contains detailed error messages with timestamps
- **Last Processed** column: Shows when content was successfully processed

This is the **most visible** way to monitor processing since you see it every time you add new content.

### 2. **Email Notifications via MailerLite**
Get email alerts for:
- ✅ Processing summaries after each cron run
- ❌ Critical errors and failures
- 🚨 Unauthorized access attempts
- 📝 New content added notifications

## 📧 **Email Setup - MailerLite (Recommended)**

Since FutureFast.AI already uses MailerLite for form submissions, we've integrated it as the primary email notification provider for consistency.

### Getting Your MailerLite API Key:

1. **Log into MailerLite Dashboard**
   - Go to [app.mailerlite.com](https://app.mailerlite.com)
   - Use your existing FutureFast.AI MailerLite account

2. **Generate API Key**
   - Click on your profile (top right)
   - Go to **Integrations** → **API**
   - Generate a new API token
   - Copy the token (starts with `ml_...`)

3. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables:**
   ```
   MAILERLITE_API_KEY=ml_your_api_token_here
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
   ```

### Alternative Email Providers (Fallback):
- **Resend**: Set `RESEND_API_KEY` if you prefer Resend
- **Console Logging**: Works automatically if no email service is configured

## 🚨 **What You'll Be Notified About**

### Processing Summaries (Every 2 Hours)
Beautiful branded emails like:
```
✅ Content Processing Complete: 3/4 successful
Message: Cron job completed with 3 successful and 1 failed out of 4 total records.
```

### Critical Errors
```
❌ Critical Error in Content Processing
Message: A critical error occurred during content processing: Failed to extract content from URL
```

### New Content Added
```
📝 New Content Added to Notion - Processing Started
Message: New content "AI Breakthrough Article" has been added and will be processed in the next cycle.
```

### Security Alerts
```
🚨 Unauthorized cron request detected
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard**

### In Your Notion Database
When you add new URLs, immediately check:
1. **Processing Status** - Should change from empty → "Processing" → "Completed"
2. **Processing Error** - Should remain empty (any text here means an error)
3. **Last Processed** - Should show recent timestamp when completed

### Quick Status Check URLs
- `https://futurefast.ai/api/unified-content` - Current processing stats
- `https://futurefast.ai/api/notion-news` - Active Notion articles

## 🔧 **Environment Variables to Add**

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```env
# Email Notifications (MailerLite Primary)
MAILERLITE_API_KEY=ml_your_api_token_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com

# Alternative Email Services (Optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key_here

# Already configured (but verify they exist)
NOTION_TOKEN=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
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=216b576203ba80aebcecfad93320f4f7
CRON_SECRET=CRONKEY2025
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

## 🎯 **Next Cron Cycle**
Your next scheduled processing will run at **17:00 UTC (5:00 PM UTC)** today.

## ✅ **Testing the System**

To test notifications manually:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer CRONKEY2025" \
  https://futurefast.ai/api/cron/ai-processing
```

This will trigger the processing and send you a test notification via MailerLite.
