# Form Integration Requirements

## Current Status
The current Google Forms integration is not meeting our requirements because:
- It requires redirecting users to Google Forms or shows cookie consent dialogs
- It doesn't maintain our custom design aesthetic consistently
- It creates a disjointed user experience

## Requirements for Form Solution

### User Experience
- Must maintain the custom design aesthetic of the FutureFast site
- Must keep users on our site (no redirects to external services)
- Must provide seamless submission with immediate feedback
- Must be transparent and effortless for the user

### Technical Requirements
- Must work with our Next.js architecture
- Must be reliable in both development and production environments
- Must handle form validation client-side
- Must securely transmit data to a storage solution

### Design Specifications
- Form should match the existing dark theme with purple accents
- Input fields should have the same styling as our initial implementation
- Success and error states should be clearly communicated
- Mobile responsiveness is essential

## Potential Solutions to Explore

### 1. Custom API Route with Database
- Create a Next.js API route to handle form submissions
- Store data in a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Supabase
- Pros: Complete control, no external dependencies
- Cons: Requires database setup and maintenance

### 2. Serverless Function Integration
- Use Vercel serverless functions to process form submissions
- Connect to a database or storage service
- Pros: Scales well, integrates with our hosting
- Cons: May have cold start issues

### 3. Third-Party Form Services with API
- Use services like Formspree, FormKeep, or Netlify Forms
- Integrate via API rather than redirects
- Pros: Managed solution, less maintenance
- Cons: Potential costs, external dependency

### 4. Email Service Integration
- Send form data directly to an email service via API
- Use services like SendGrid, Mailchimp, or ConvertKit
- Pros: Built for collecting subscriber information
- Cons: May require additional setup

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate the above options based on complexity, cost, and maintenance
2. Select a solution that balances user experience with technical feasibility
3. Implement a proof of concept
4. Test thoroughly in development and production environments
5. Deploy the final solution

## Timeline
This should be revisited as a priority item to ensure a seamless experience for users wanting to subscribe to the FutureFast mailing list.
